        <h2>Key Points</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A minimum of 30 credits (7.5 courses) in topic-specific engineering electives.</li>
            <li>A minimum of 12 credits (3 courses) must start with the code ENG-UH.</li>
            <li>To verify course eligibility, contact Prof. Khaled Shahin, the ABET accreditation coordinator (<a href="mailto:kos3@nyu.edu">kos3@nyu.edu</a>).</li>
            <li>Graduate-level courses are an option but require permission from the General Engineering Dean, Prof. Margaret Julias (<a href="mailto:margaret.julias@nyu.edu">margaret.julias@nyu.edu</a>).</li>
            <li>Graduate-level courses are 3-credit courses; taking more than 2 of these may set you back in acquiring the 30 credits.</li>

  <h2 style="text-align: left; color: #333;">A Guide to Taking Graduate-Level Courses While Studying Abroad for General Engineering Students</h2>
  <p style="text-align: left; color: #555; font-size: 16px;">
    For General Engineering students planning to take graduate-level courses during a study abroad semester, careful planning and understanding of the process are essential. Below is a step-by-step guide based on insights from experienced students:
  </p>
  <hr>
  <div style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 16px; color: #444;">
    <h3 style="color: #333;">1. Securing Approvals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Seek Permission from the General Engineering Dean:</strong> Begin by obtaining approval from the General Engineering Dean. At NYUAD, Prof. Margaret Julias is highly approachable and can guide you through the process.</li>
      <li><strong>Contact the Graduate School or Center:</strong> Reach out to the graduate school or department offering the courses you're interested in. Deans and academic staff in NYC will handle the registration process and provide detailed instructions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Prepare a list of potential courses in advance, as you may not gain access to all your preferred options.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 style="color: #333;">2. Course Eligibility and Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Courses Must Be Under Tandon:</strong> Ensure that the graduate courses are taught by engineering faculty and are listed under NYU Tandon to count toward your General Engineering degree.</li>
      <li><strong>Eligibility Verification:</strong> For any questions about course eligibility, contact Prof. Khaled Shahin from the NYUAD Civil Engineering Department. He is also the ABET accreditation coordinator and can confirm if a course meets the degree requirements.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3 style="color: #333;">3. Credit Load Management</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Limit to Two Graduate Courses:</strong> While graduate courses may have fewer lecture hours, they are typically project-intensive and time-consuming.</li>
      <li>General Engineering students are often advised not to take more than two graduate courses to balance workload effectively.</li>
      <li>Taking more than two 3-credit graduate courses can also hinder your ability to complete the required 30 credits (or 7.5 courses) in topic-specific engineering electives.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3 style="color: #333;">4. Building a Backup Plan</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prepare Extra Course Options:</strong> Since not all courses may be available to you, always have a backup list. Discuss your options with the deans and academic advisors early in the process.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3 style="color: #333;">5. Time Management Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Factor in Project Intensiveness:</strong> Graduate courses typically involve significant project work, which can be demanding. Time management will be key to maintaining a healthy balance between academics and other commitments.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3 style="color: #333;">6. Leverage Faculty and Peer Advice</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Faculty Guidance:</strong> Stay in touch with professors and deans for advice and clarification throughout the process.</li>
      <li><strong>Peer Insights:</strong> Reach out to students who have previously taken graduate courses. They can provide valuable tips and "hacks" to handle urgent matters or manage setbacks effectively.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3 style="color: #333;">7. Stay Organised with a Calendar</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep track of all deadlines, including:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Permission requests</li>
        <li>Course registration dates</li>
        <li>Application deadlines for study abroad</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Sync this calendar with your personal schedule to avoid missing any important milestones.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <h3 style="text-align: left; color: #333;">Final Thoughts</h3>
  <p style="text-align: left; color: #555; font-size: 16px;">
    Graduate-level courses can be an enriching part of your General Engineering degree, but they require careful planning and consideration. By securing approvals, verifying course eligibility, and managing your workload, you can make the most of this opportunity during your study abroad semester.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left; color: #555; font-size: 16px;">
    If you have further questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to consult your professors, deans, or peers—they’re there to help you succeed.
